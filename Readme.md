signpost-retrofit
========

A [Retrofit][1] extension to [oauth-signpost][2].

The extension comes with a `SigningOkClient` helper class to use with [OkHttp][3] when building the `RestAdapter`.

Usage
=======

To use, simply create an instance of `SigningOkClient` providing it a `RetrofitHttpOAuthConsumer`.

This will add the necessary oAuth headers to each request.

```java
RetrofitHttpOAuthConsumer oAuthConsumer = new RetrofitHttpOAuthConsumer(key, secret);
oAuthConsumer.setTokenWithSecret(token, secret);
OkClient client = new SigningOkClient(oAuthConsumer);
RestAdapter adapter = new RestAdapter.Builder()
                                    .setEndpoint("...")
                                    .setClient(client)
                                    .build();
```

Note that this extension does not (currently) include `HttpOAuthProvider` and `HttpResponseAdapter` implementations.

Download
=======

```groovy

	    maven {
	        url "https://jitpack.io"
